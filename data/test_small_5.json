        "article": "The mother and daughter who survived a tragic car accident this week, which saw three children die, have been reunited. Aluel Manyang was\u00a0moved from the intensive care unit at the Royal Children's about 5.15pm on Friday, and greeted her distraught mother, Akon Goode, with a 'big hug', her father said. 'She didn't believe that her mum was still alive,' Joseph Manyang said, according to the Herald Sun. Scroll down for videos . Aueel Manyang, pictured here as a baby with her mother Akon Guode,\u00a0believes her three siblings who died in the crash at a Melbourne lake were eaten by crocodiles in the water . Ms Guode visited her daughter for the first time but did not stay the night in the hospital. Mr Manyang said his daughter was expected to make a '100 per cent' recovery and she should be allowed to go home within four days. The five-year-old girl who survived when a car driven by her mother plunged into a lake believes her three siblings who died in the crash were eaten by crocodiles. Aluel Manyang believes her younger sister and two brothers died when they were taken by a crocodile because the children associate the giant reptiles with water. Her siblings -\u00a0one-year-old brother Bol and\u00a0four-year-old twins Madit and Anger - died after their mother Akon Guode crashed\u00a0her 4WD into a lake at Wyndham Vale in Melbourne's outer west on Wednesday. The crash on Wednesday killed four-year-old twins Madit and Anger (pictured) and their one-year-old brother Bol when the 4WD plunged into a lake . The children's father, Joseph Tito Manyang, says five-year-old Awel remains in a serious condition at the Royal Children's Hospital but she remembers the accident. 'Always when they see water they think of crocodiles, so that's what she said. She said they'd fallen into the water and there were crocodiles eating my younger brothers and sister,' Mr Manyang said. 'I went to see her yesterday and she was happy to see me. She knew me when I asked: 'Do you know me?' She said, 'Yeah, you're Daddy'.' Mr Manyang's partner and mother of the children, Akon Guode, was released from police custody on Thursday night after homicide detectives questioned her over the crash. She told him she was feeling 'very dizzy' before the accident\u00a0and remembers her children crying out. One-year-old Bol (left) and four-year-old twins Madit and Anger (right) all died after the 4WD they were in crashed into a lake at Wyndham Vale in Melbourne's outer west just before 4pm on Wednesday . Ms Guode has been sent to stay with a relative after portraits of the deceased children and memories of them running around the family home became too much. 'She's very shocked,' Mr Manyang said. 'She was crying every 10 minutes. She remembers everything at home and how the kids were walking around and playing.' Mr Manyang says his partner told him she 'didn't feel herself' as she was driving and can only remember parts of the aftermath of the crash,\u00a0The Age\u00a0reports. But she does recall being in the water and hearing her surviving five-year-old daughter Awel saying 'Mama, the children are falling under the water'. Mr Manyang was struggling with the news his three young children had died. 'The feeling is very hard for me,' he said. 'My kids, they were very good ... always, they were happy. Especially the twins. It is a big shock to me to get this information.' He revealed Ms Guode called him at 2.16pm on Wednesday afternoon but by the time he returned the call there was no answer. 'Bol, is still shy, is one year and a half, always we play together, that's what has happened, but it is a big shock for me to get this information. It has happened to me, to lose three children at once,' he told SBS radio. The children's father, Joseph Tito Manyang (second from right), was hugged by a mourner at the crash site\u00a0at Wyndham Vale in Melbourne's outer west . It comes as Mr Manyang defended the children's mother earlier on Thursday saying he didn't believe she caused the crash deliberately and said she was extremely distressed. 'She is a very good mother,' he told the Herald Sun. 'She loved the kids. She took care of the kids. I don't think she planned to do anything. 'I'm still believing she's innocent. 'My message to the community - because there is a lot of talking around, there is untruths - what I can tell them is they have to wait for the report from the police investigation, that will be the truth.' He  made an emotional visit to the crash site on Thursday where floral tributes were starting to build up from the Sudanese community who knew the family and from strangers. Ms Guode, who is the mother of seven children, came to Melbourne from South Sudan to escape war after her first husband died. The children's mother, Akorn Manang, was behind the wheel of grey 2005 Toyota Kluger when it plunged into the lake on Manor Lakes Boulevard . Police have retrieved the four-wheel-drive after it was plunged into the Wyndham Vale on Wednesday . Mourners pray at a makeshift shrine at the scene where a 4WD was submerged in Lake Gladman . Mr Manyang's 16-year-old niece, Amani Alier, said the family were trying to console him following the devastating news. 'He's shattered, he couldn't stop crying, his nose was bleeding,' she said. 'He just dropped when he saw a picture of his son on the wall. It's so hard for him to deal with. He loved those kids.' It follows as the four-wheel-drive was removed from the lake on Thursday afternoon. Thomas Kok, the cousin of the children's father, who spent the night at the children's hospital with Awel, visited the crash site on Thursday morning to pay tribute to the children. 'It's a shock for everyone,' Mr Kok said, according to the Herald Sun.\u00a0'We spent all night at hospital until 3 in the morning.' It comes as the tight-knit Sudanese community and nearby residents started leaving floral tributes for the three children. 'As soon as I saw the community coming towards this scene where the incident's happened, it's making me feel like people care,' Mr Kok said. The tight-knit Sudanese community and nearby residents started leaving floral tributes for the three children . The 2005 Toyota Kluger is expected to be removed from the lake late on Thursday morning . The family with seven children moved from South Sudan to Australia in 2008 . Thomas Kok, the cousin of the children's father, who spent the night at the children's hospital with Awel, visited the crash site on Thursday morning to pay tribute to the children . Police have confirmed the mother is assisting the homicide squad with their investigation as they appealed for members of the Sudanese community to come forward if they knew anything about what was going on in the family's life. 'We need to understand what led to this, we need to understand the background of this family, we need to understand what was happening in their lives,' Superintendent Stuart Bateson said. 'Hopefully this will lead to a greater understanding of what led to this incident. We appeal especially to the Sudanese community who might know what was happening in this family's life, what their movements were before this tragedy.' A witness Michelle relived the tragic moment the car ploughed into the lake on Thursday morning. 'It is still in my mind now, every time you close your eyes you just see someone so little,' she told Nine News in tears. 'My heart goes out to the family and to everybody who witnessed it. 'Those rescuers, those workers, when it was winding down it was just devastating seeing them sitting in the gutter.' Michelle told 3AW late on Wednesday that her friend Travis rescued one of the young boys from the vehicle. 'Travis jumped into the water and smashed the back windscreen and got one little boy out. (Emergency workers) then started working on the child,' she said. 'I only saw three get taken out. I believe they were travelling down the boulevard...and they've just gone over and into the lake.' Emotions were still raw on Thursday morning for neighbour Michelle who witnessed the grey 2005 Toyota Kluger plunging into the lake on Manor Lakes Boulevard . The search and rescue team remained at the scene to try and pull the car from the water, which is reportedly about 20 to 30 metres from shore . Locals are shocked as to how the car was able to get into the centre of the lake as it is 'pretty far from the road' Detective from the Homicide Squad and the Major Collision Investigation Unit have spoken to some witnesses but they are appealing for anyone with information to come forward. It is not yet know if it was a deliberate act or an accident, according to police. It's believed the grey 2005 Toyota Kluger 4WD was travelling towards Pedder St and Minindee Road when the incident occurred. Police particularly wish to speak to anyone who saw the car between 3.30 and 3.45pm. Witnesses or anyone with further information about the incident should contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000. A mini shrine for the three young children grew on Thursday as families visited the area to pay their respects . Two young girls carried flowers to the lake where three three died when the car they were in crashed . Victoria police said that the exact circumstances of how the car went into the lake are yet to be determined . A resident named Michelle told 3AW that her neighbour broke open the back windscreen of the 4WD to save the children . Victoria Ambulance said the children were taken to The Royal Children's hospital via air ambulance . Further tests will be conducted in order to determine whether the car had any mechanical defects .",

        "article": "The mother of a two-year-old boy who fell 10 feet into a cheetah enclosure could face child endangerment charges after witnesses claim she was dangling him over the edge. Visitors at Cleveland Metroparks Zoo in Ohio heard a scream as the toddler tumbled into the pit at 3pm on Saturday. His parents jumped in and pulled him to safety before paramedics arrived to treat the boy for a leg injury. Though the felines appeared to avoid the child, Dr Christopher Kuhar, executive director at the zoo, said there is a strong chance charges will be pressed on Monday. Scroll down for video . A mother was holding the two-year-old boy and another child when the toddler slipped and fell into the cheetah exhibit at the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo (file photo of cheetahs at the Cleveland zoo) The boy was rescued by his parents from the pit (pictured) before firefighters and paramedics arrived on the scene. He suffered from minor bumps and bruises and was listed in stable condition at the hospital . He told CNN: 'Unfortunately, we have a number of eyewitness accounts that point to the strong likelihood that the child was dangled over the rail.' According to witnesses the mother was holding him and another child when he fell. Michael Lurie and his family were at the Cheetah exhibit when they heard the child scream. 'You saw how far the drop was and you just couldn't believe the kid didn't hurt himself from falling down on the ground,' Lurie told WKYC. 'I was just shocked,' he said. 'I didn't understand how the parents let the kid go over the thing.' The cheetahs did not approach the boy or his parents while in the pit, according to zoo officials. Zoo visitor Terra Lurie believes the boy was not approached by the fast feline because they were frightened. 'I think they were just curious as to what was going on and why somebody was in the pen with them,' she said. 'It's not every day that somebody is just in the pen with them.' 'And everyone else is screaming and they probably got scared.' The exhibit was closed following the child's fall. Zoo visitor Michael Lurie was at the cheetah exhibit when he heard the child scream.

        "article": "The pups came from as far away as New Jersey and Tennessee in hopes of landing a new nickname: 'Beautiful Bulldog.' They were all defeated by a native who likes eating snow and watching turtles. A 2-year-old dog from Des Moines named Tank won the 36th annual Beautiful Bulldog contest Sunday at Drake University. Scroll down for video . Winner: Tank, a 2-year-old bulldog from Iowa won Drake University's 36th annual 'Beautiful Bulldog' contest Sunday . A real beauty: Tank, who enjoys eating snow and watching turtles, will now serve as mascot of this year's Drake Relays . Tank received top honors as well as a crown and cape. He will appear before more than 16,000 fans -- or, royal subjects -- at the university's Drake Relays to be honored as mascot of the event, which will be held from Thursday through Saturday, according to the contest's\u00a0website. The tongue-in-cheek beauty pageant, which featured 50 dogs, is the kickoff event for the Drake Relays track meet. 'He's funny,' said Tank's owner, Duane Smith. 'He's a real good one.' Pageant organizers narrowed a pool of more than 100 hopeful pups by a lottery held last month. Owner: Here, Tank enjoys a rub from his owner, Duane Smith, after winning the 36th annual contest .

Should Tank be unable to fulfill his duties as the Drake Relays mascot, fellow Des Moines pup Steve will step in. Steve was second even though he was initially so shy about the makeshift catwalk set up on Drake's basketball court that his owner had to pick him up and plunk him down, much to the delight of the few thousand spectators on hand.

        "summary": "Dame Sally Davies has ordered review into cost of giving out free vitamins .\nComes after a rise in the number of cases of rickets in children in the UK .\nIncrease is being put down to fact children spend less time outside playing .\nRickets can cause bone deformities such as bowed legs and a curved spine .",
        "article": "Doctors have called for under-fours to be given free vitamins after a rise in the number of cases of rickets due to a lack of exposure to sunlight. The country's chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies is said to be concerned at the number of children suffering from the condition, which is caused by a deficiency in vitamin D. The disease, a scourge of Victorian Britain, was virtually eradicated after the Second World War but is returning as more and more youngsters are used to staying indoors playing video games than going outside. Scroll down for video . Dame Sally Davies, the country's chief medical officer, who has ordered a cost review into giving all under-fours free vitamin D supplements . Now, it has been reported that Professor Davies has ordered the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice) to review the cost of providing vitamin supplements to all children under the age of four, in a bid to reverse the trend. The move is being supported by one of Britain's leading experts on vitamin D deficiency at University College Hospital London Alastair Sutcliffe, who has spoken about an 'epidemic' of cases due to a lack of sun exposure and overuse of sunscreen. He told the Sunday Times: 'Nothing is free but the cost of the ill-effects of deficiency, such as rickets and anaemia from families not providing children with these supplements is greater for the NHS. 'Sunblock is so powerful it does work but you end up with no exposure to the sun. 'The outcome is that you are blocking out sunshine and you have a secondary effect of reduced exposure to sunshine which the human race needs.' Rickets is caused by a deficiency in vitamin D and causes bone deformities such as bowed legs, pictured, and a curvature of the spine . Rickets, which is also known as soft bones, can cause deformities such as bowed legs and a curvature of the spine. During the war children were given food supplements such as cod liver oil, but this practice stopped in the 1950s. An estimated 40 per cent of children are estimated to have vitamin D levels below the recommended amount. Figures from the NHS show there were 833 hospital admissions for children suffering from the condition  in the financial year 2012-13. Professor Davies has previously spoken out about the advantages of giving free vitamins to young children. A scheme has already been set up in deprived areas of Birmingham handing out supplements, which has halved the number of cases of rickets and other deficiency problems. She said: 'We are offering these vitamins to vulnerable children and the take-up is low, but many children not in these communities need them too.' The NHS already recommends all youngsters aged six months to five years take the vitamins, but parents must pay for them unless they are part of the NHS\u2019s means-tested Healthy Start scheme. Professor Davies said the UK\u2019s record on children\u2019s health used to be \u2018one of the best but we are now the worst\u2019. Possible causes include lifestyle behaviours in pregnancy such as smoking, and poor care in infancy. Rickets, or soft and deformed bones, was first noted by physicians in ancient Rome but was not linked with lack of vitamin D until the start of the 20th century. It was common in Victorian times because of lack of access to sunlight \u2013 which the body needs to make vitamin D \u2013 and poor diets. It mostly disappeared in the West during the 1940s thanks to the fortification of foods such as margarine, and children were also routinely given cod liver oil. Rickets is still a major problem in third-world countries. However, UK cases have been rising in the past 15 years, from 183 in 1996 to 762 in 2011. Experts believe this is partly because children are eating less fish and eggs than in the past. They also blame extensive use of sunscreen, and children spending more time indoors.",

        "article": "This is the shocking moment a toddler was left hanging by her neck as she tried to climb out of her cot - and was only saved because her mother was watching her on the baby monitor. Ophelia Conant had managed to crawl backwards through a gap in the cot at her home in Holmer Green, Buckinghamshire, but was left hanging mid air by her neck. The furniture boss who supplied the beds, Phillip Dickens, who was described as the 'king of DIY' was today fined \u00a350,000 and given a suspended prison sentence. Ophelia Conant managed to crawl backwards out of her cot and get trapped between the horizontal handrail . The 19-month-old was left dangling mid air by her neck and was only saved because her mother had been watching her on the baby monitor . The 19-month-old was only saved when her mother, Louise Conant, happened to be watching the incident unfold on a baby monitor. Days later a second toddler was found dangling from the \u00a3450 bed with his forehead jammed against the horizontal handrail. Both mothers had purchased the Nutkin three-drawer cotbeds from Dicken's company, Baumhaus Ltd, which had the beds produced in China and imported back into Britain for distribution. Amersham Crown Court heard Mrs Conant had put Ophelia in the cotbed for her lunchtime sleep on April 16, 2013, when she saw her getting into difficulty via the video monitoring system. She rushed upstairs to find her daughter hanging by her neck, which had become lodged in a gap between the end of the bed and a horizontal handrail. Judge Karen Holt told Dickens: 'Seeing her daughter on the baby video monitor screen hanging by her neck was, using her words, beyond description and completely traumatic to her. 'One can only imagine the horror that mother must have felt. In her view, it is without doubt the fact she had a video monitor that saved her daughter's life.' She added: 'This is a serious offence because it came through your negligence. It could have caused the loss of life of babies. 'The crown's case against the company and you was, with your negligence, this unsafe product was put on the market. 'Clearly, you did not act with all due diligence, or take all reasonable precautions to make sure such a situation would not occur. 'The product itself was dealing with the most vulnerable people in society, and I know that you accept that.' Louise Conant with her daughter Ophelia today after what she described as a 'traumatic' experience . Judge Holt said the design of the cot 'could have been fatal' and added that although Dickens and the company had been 'naive and negligent', there was 'very strong mitigation' on their behalf. Nine days after Ophelia's incident, Deborah Turner, from Northamptonshire found her son dangling on the outside of the cot with his forehead jammed against the horizontal handrail. 'It took both her and her mother to lift her son back through the gap,' said Judge Holt. Mrs Conant complained to Trading Standards at Buckinghamshire County Council and officers took away the cotbed before confronting Baumhaus. They were shown a copy of the video of Ophelia and immediately recalled all the cots it had sent out around the country. The court was told no health and safety tests were carried out in the UK, with the only quality control being made in the Chinese factory, which did not comply with British safety standards. Following test reports and an offer from Dickens to give Mrs Conant a part-refund, Baumhaus was served a product recall notice in July 2013, which recovered 93 per cent of the 212 cotbeds sold. The following month Trading Standards received three lab test reports which identified failures, including test parameters and clauses relating to strength of certain parts, finger, head and neck entrapment, and BSI standards markings. Thames Valley Police visited Baumhaus in October and seized computer equipment. A month later Dickens was interviewed under caution during which he confirmed the company had designed the Nutkin cotbed, which was produced in China and imported back into Britain for distribution. The court heard the prototype had been tested and passed in 2010 but the product placed on the market in 2013 had different dimensions and Dickens had no proper quality control in this country. In mitigation Sunyana Sharma told the court neither Dickens nor Baumhaus set out to harm children with their cotbed, and the company accepted that it failed in not having proper quality control. She added that the company had acted quickly to remove the product from distribution and done all it could to trace the remaining cots, all of which were accepted by Judge Holt. Phillip Dickens, company director of furniture supplier Baumhaus Ltd, which distributed the beds, was today given a suspended prison sentence for placing an unsafe product on the market . Judge Holt described this as a serious offence but said the court acknowledged naivety and negligence on the part of the defendant, who at the time had no manufacturing experience, kept no technical product notes, and relied on an external company for testing to assess compliance with relevant British Standards. Dickens, described as 'the king of DIY' on a profile on the Baumhaus website, entered pleas on the company's behalf at an earlier hearing, admitting two counts of placing an unsafe product on the market between January 2010 and July 2013. The 38-year-old, of Burnley, Lancashire, was given a three month prison sentence suspended for 12 months. He also pleaded guilty to a similar charge relating to his company, which is based near Bicester, Oxfordshire, and ordered to pay \u00a3500 to the two mothers. Baumhaus was given a \u00a312,000 fine and Dickens and his company also face\u00a0prosecution costs of \u00a335,653. Judge Holt said she felt able to suspend the jail sentence because of his lack of intent to cause injury in supplying the potentially deadly cots to the market. She added: 'It is very difficult to put a figure on the clear distress that both these ladies suffered.' In a statement read through solicitor Tim Healy, Dickens and Baumhaus said they 'sincerely regretted' any distress caused to the families. Speaking outside court Dickens' solicitor, Mr Healy, said: 'Baumhaus Limited and Philip Dickens wish to express their sincere regret for any distress caused to the families effected. 'Health and safety remains of paramount concern to Mr Dickens and the company.' Speaking after the hearing Mrs Conant said the court case brought an element of closure to the nightmare experience of seeing her daughter trapped by her neck in her cot. She said: 'I bought what I thought was the best for Ophelia - a premium quality cot bed. But it turned out to be a living hell. Standards Officers Rebecca Kaya (right) and Kirit Vadia (left) examine the Nutkin three-drawer cotbed . 'For a long time afterwards it gave me nightmares, and it made me nervous about putting Ophelia to bed. 'The video monitor definitely saved her life. I'd never have thought to buy one, but a friend suggested it. Now I'd urge every parent to consider a video monitor for their child.' Trading Standards Officer Rebecca Kaya, who led the investigation, said the case demonstrated the department's commitment to protecting families from products posing a safety risk, and was an example of the tough measures they were prepared to take. She said: 'This case highlights the need to be very careful buying online. Before clicking the \"buy\" button, make sure you have a manufacturer's code, product code and full contact details of the retailer, including a cancellation process in case you need to return the product, or there is a safety problem.' Ms Kaya added that they believe there are still 12 cotbeds out there that weren't reached during the product recall.",
